### Fork the repo

1. Fork the repository, you just need the `main` branch
2. Push the forked public repository or create a new private repository on GitHub:
    1. git init
    2. git add .
    3. git commit -m "first commit"
    4. git branch -M main
    5. git remote add origin ...
    6. git push -u origin main

### On Cloudflare

3. Create a project underneath Cloudflare Workers & Pages
    *  [Connect the repository](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/guide/#connect-your-git-provider-to-pages)
    * Configure your deployment and build setup:
      * Framework preset: (leave empty)
      * Build command: `cat static.lnk dynamic.lnk > build/_redirects`
      * Build output directory: `/build`
    * The build will fail as you still need to generate `static.lnk`, `dynamic.lnk`, and `build/_headers` later in the process
4. Setup a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/custom-domains/) for your page project
    * Configure the DNS entry via [Cloudflare DNS](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)

### Local config

5. Define your configuration in the `vanityURLs.conf` with your preferred text editor or via `make config` if `vi` is your cup of tea
  * SCRIPT_DIR: the path to your local scripts folder included in your path
  * REPO_DIR: the path to your local copy of vanityURLs
  * MY_DOMAIN: your tiny internet domain served by Cloudflare
  * MY_PAGE: your cloudflare's specific page URL
6. Build your initial setup with `make setup`
  * Generate the [header configuration](../build/_headers) based on your cloudflare's specific page URL and _tiny_ internet domain name
  * Generate the initial [static.lnk](../static.lnk) and [dynamic.lnk](../dynamic.lnk)
7. Update the [static](../static.lnk) and [dynamic](../dynamic.lnk) redirection lists with your preferred text editor and the [`lnk` bash script](../script/lnk)
8. Update the main branch of your local git repository and push to GitHub
9. Cloudflare will detect the change and initiate a deployment, please give ~15 seconds for your links to become valid
10. Open the defined fully qualified domain name for your _tiny_ internet domain name in your web browser, and you should be redirected to https://BHDicaire.com based on the [initial configuration](../build/_redirects)
11. Fine tune the [static](../static.lnk) and [dynamic](../dynamic.lnk) redirection lists with your preferred text editor and the [`lnk` bash script](../scripts/lnk)
12. Add and commit the change to the github repository

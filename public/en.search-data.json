Card supports three kinds of images:\nRemote image: the full URL in the image parameter. Static image: use the relative path in Hugo‚Äôs static/ directory. Processed image: use the relative path in Hugo‚Äôs assets/ directory. Hextra auto-detects if image processing is needed during build and applies the options parameter or default settings (Resize, 800x, Quality 80, WebP Format). It currently supports these method: Resize, Fit, Fill and Crop.\nFor more on Hugo‚Äôs built in image processing commands, methods, and options see their Image Processing Documentation.","usage#Usage":" {{\u003c/* cards */\u003e}} {{\u003c/* card link=\"../callout\" title=\"Callout\" icon=\"warning\" */\u003e}} {{\u003c/* card link=\"/\" title=\"No Icon\" */\u003e}} {{\u003c/* /cards */\u003e}} {{\u003c/* cards */\u003e}} {{\u003c/* card link=\"/\" title=\"Image Card\" image=\"https://source.unsplash.com/featured/800x600?landscape\" subtitle=\"Unsplash Landscape\" */\u003e}} {{\u003c/* card link=\"/\" title=\"Local Image\" image=\"/images/card-image-unprocessed.jpg\" subtitle=\"Raw image under static directory.\" */\u003e}} {{\u003c/* card link=\"/\" title=\"Local Image\" image=\"images/space.jpg\" subtitle=\"Image under assets directory, processed by Hugo.\" method=\"Resize\" options=\"600x q80 webp\" */\u003e}} {{\u003c/* /cards */\u003e}} "},"title":"Cards"},"/en/docs/guide/shortcodes/details/":{"data":{"":"A built-in component to display a collapsible content.","example#Example":" Details This is the content of the details.\nMarkdown is supported.\nClick me to reveal This will be hidden by default.

You can redirect at the service level, within a page or via JavaScript if enabled.\nThe simplest way to redirect to another URL is to use an HTML tag with the http-equiv parameter set to ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù. The content attribute sets the delay before the browser redirects the user to the new web page.
